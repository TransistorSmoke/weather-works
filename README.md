# WeatherWorks

I made this app to check the weather for the day in my workplace, the CBD, suburb and city.
I use it daily. It helps me plan out given the weather for these places.

As a PWA, I use service worker to make in work offline. It prompts for updates with new changes deployed.
Firebase is used for hosting.
